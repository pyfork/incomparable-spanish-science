# Prevent line continuation errors
Please ensure the code is structured with short, readable lines to avoid 'end of line without line continuation' errors.

# Prevent let errors
Ensure that all variables are declared and assigned following Pine Script's syntax rules. Avoid using unsupported keywords like 'let' for variable declarations.

Please break down the script's logic into clear steps, with each step correctly declaring and assigning variables as needed.

Include comments explaining each variable's purpose and how it is assigned a value.

# Prevent local scope errors
Please ensure that any plotting functions, such as plotshape, are used outside of any loops or local scope blocks to avoid scope errors.

# Use corrrect parameter for box
Ensure that when using box.new to draw boxes, the correct parameter for setting the box's background color is used. Note that box.new does not have a 'color' parameter; instead, use 'bgcolor' for background color.
